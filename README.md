REact js app for converting american units to metric units
This code defines a simple React component for a unit converter. It has two input fields: one for the American unit value and one for the metric unit value. When the user enters a value in the American unit field, it triggers the handleAmericanChange function, which updates the state with the entered value and calls the convertToMetric function to perform the conversion. The converted metric unit value is then displayed in the metric unit input field.
